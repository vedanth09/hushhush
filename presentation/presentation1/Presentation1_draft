                    Topic Name: Mission AI-Possible: Discreet Talent Hunt



User Story: 

Mr. Liam Hunt, the CEO of Doodle, was dissatisfied with the quality of candidates provided by external hiring companies, as they lacked the essential skills he expected. After careful deliberation, Mr. Hunt decided to take over the recruitment process himself. Inspired by his love for the Mission Impossible movie series, he conceived the idea of developing a sophisticated AI recruitment tool. This tool would thoroughly analyze the public digital profiles of top IT professionals, allowing the team to efficiently identify and hire the best talent while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy.

To initiate the selection process, Mr. Hunt plans to send interview invitations as pop-up messages to potential candidates. These messages will state, "You have been selected by us for the [specific role]. After careful consideration, we invite you to take a comprehensive test (interview). Should you choose to accept this test?" The candidate will then need to click 'yes' or 'no' to proceed.
